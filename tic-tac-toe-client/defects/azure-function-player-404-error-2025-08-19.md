# Azure Function Player 404 Error

## Status
FIXED - 2025-08-19

## Severity
HIGH

## Date Found
2025-08-19

## Summary
Azure Function AI player fails with 404 error and causes the game to display an error message instead of functioning properly.

## Environment
- Browser: Playwright (Chromium-based)
- OS: Windows
- Application: Tic Tac Toe React Client
- Version: Based on package.json 2.0.0

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch the application
2. Click "Player O" configuration dropdown
3. Select the "Azure function (remote)" option
4. Set Player X to any AI type (tested with "Menace AI (local)")
5. Click "New game"

## Expected Behavior
- Game should start properly
- Azure Function AI should make moves via remote API calls
- Game should proceed normally with both players making moves

## Actual Behavior
- The game starts, but Azure Function player fails to make a move
- Console shows "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)"
- Game displays the error message: "Something unexpected happened: Error: takeTurn failed"
- Menace AI (X) places its first move in the center cell
- Game becomes stuck waiting for O's move that never comes

## Technical Details
- Console Error: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) @ http://loca...`
- UI Error Message: "Something unexpected happened: Error: takeTurn failed"
- Error appears to be network-related (404 Not Found)

## Root Cause Analysis
Likely causes:
1. Azure Function endpoint is not configured or not running
2. Network connectivity issues to the Azure Function
3. Incorrect URL configuration for the Azure Function endpoint
4. Azure Function deployment issues

## Impact
- Azure Function AI player is completely non-functional
- Users cannot test remote AI functionality
- Error messages are not user-friendly for network issues
- Game becomes unplayable when Azure Function player is selected

## Suggested Fixes
1. **Medium Priority**: Improve error handling to provide user-friendly messages for network failures
2. **Medium Priority**: Add a configuration to enable/disable the Azure Function player (as the backend is currently not even deployed anymore)
3. **Low Priority**: Add a retry mechanism for network failures
4. **Low Priority**: Add timeout handling for slow network responses

## Test Data
- Player X: Menace AI (local) — Working
- Player O: Azure function (remote) — Failing with 404
- Auto new game: Disabled
- Game state: Game starts but fails on first O move

## Reproduction Rate
100% — Error occurs every time Azure Function player is selected

## Fix Implementation

**Date Fixed**: 2025-08-19  
**Fixed By**: Claude Code Assistant

### Root Cause Identified
1. Incorrect environment variable (`REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE` instead of `REACT_APP_AZURE_FUNCTION_BASE_URL`)
2. Missing network error handling and retry logic  
3. Poor user experience when backend service is unavailable
4. No timeout configuration for network requests

### Changes Made

#### Files Modified:
- `/src/computer-players/AzureFunctionPlayer.ts` - Complete rewrite with enhanced error handling
- `/src/app/App.tsx` - Added conditional player configuration

#### Implemented Fixes:

1. **Fixed Environment Variable**: 
   - Corrected axios baseURL to use `REACT_APP_AZURE_FUNCTION_BASE_URL`
   - Added 30-second timeout configuration

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - User-friendly error messages for different failure types:
     - Connection timeouts: "Azure Function request timed out..."
     - 404 errors: "Azure Function service is not available..."
     - Connection refused: "Cannot connect to Azure Function service..."
     - Generic network errors with detailed messaging

3. **Retry Logic**:
   - Exponential backoff retry mechanism (three attempts)
   - Only retries on retryable network errors (timeouts, server errors, etc.)
   - Configurable retry delays starting at 1 second

4. **Conditional Player Configuration**:
   - Azure Function player only appears in the dropdown when properly configured
   - Graceful fallback when environment variables are missing

### Verification Testing

**Test Scenario**: Menace AI (X) vs Azure Function (O) with no backend service running

**Results**:
- ✅ Game starts successfully 
- ✅ Menace AI makes the first move correctly
- ✅ Network error handled gracefully (connection refused to localhost:7071)
- ✅ Retry logic executes as expected
- ✅ User-friendly error message displayed instead of game crash
- ✅ Game remains playable after error

**Console Behavior**: Shows expected network error without breaking game functionality

### Priority Fixes Completed:
- ✅ **Medium Priority**: User-friendly network failure messages
- ✅ **Medium Priority**: Configuration-based enable/disable functionality  
- ✅ **Low Priority**: Retry mechanism for network failures
- ✅ **Low Priority**: Timeout handling for network responses

### Technical Notes:
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing environment configurations
- Follows the project's TypeScript and React patterns
- Preserves existing game mechanics and AI player systems
- Error handling integrates with an existing WinnerView error display system

**Status**: All suggested fixes are implemented and verified. Defect resolved.
