# AI Players Not Making Automatic Moves

## Status
FIXED

## Severity
Critical

## Summary
AI players configured as Mock AI (and potentially other AI types) do not make automatic moves during gameplay. The game remains in a "waiting for human input" state even when both players are configured as AI.

## Environment
- **Application**: Tic-Tac-Toe Client (React/TypeScript)
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Browser**: Playwright automated testing
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Branch**: claude-guided-refactoring

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "New game" button to start a game
3. Click "Player X" button and select "Mock" from dropdown
4. Click "Player O" button and select "Mock" from dropdown
5. Optionally enable "Auto new game" checkbox
6. Observe game behavior for several seconds

## Expected Behavior
- AI players should automatically make moves without human intervention
- Mock AI should make random valid moves on empty cells
- Game should progress automatically until completion
- With auto-game mode enabled, games should play continuously

## Actual Behavior
- Game continues to display "It's your turn!" message indefinitely
- No automatic moves are made by either AI player
- Game board remains empty and unchanged
- AI configuration appears to have no effect on gameplay

## Impact
- **Core Functionality**: AI gameplay completely non-functional
- **User Experience**: Cannot test or play against AI opponents
- **Business Impact**: Major advertised feature is broken
- **Testing Impact**: Cannot verify AI algorithms or auto-game mode

## Technical Context
This suggests several possible issues:

### Game Director Issues
- GameDirector may not be properly detecting AI player types
- Turn management system might not be triggering AI player actions
- AI player initialization or registration may be failing

### Player Factory Issues  
- MockPlayer or other AI players may not be properly instantiated
- Player interface implementation might be incomplete
- Async move execution might not be properly awaited

### State Management Issues
- Game state might not be properly transitioning to AI turn phases
- Action dispatch system might not be handling AI moves
- Component re-rendering might not be triggered by AI actions

## Affected AI Types
- **Mock AI**: Confirmed non-functional
- **DQN AI**: Not tested but likely affected
- **Menace AI**: Not tested but likely affected  
- **Azure Function AI**: Not tested but likely affected

## Console Output
No errors or warnings are generated in the browser console, suggesting the issue is in the game logic rather than JavaScript runtime errors.

## Suggested Investigation Areas
1. **GameDirector.ts**: Check turn management and AI player triggering
2. **Player Factory**: Verify proper AI player instantiation
3. **MockPlayer implementation**: Ensure takeTurn() method is properly implemented
4. **Action system**: Verify AI actions are properly dispatched and handled
5. **Async handling**: Check for unhandled promises or missing await statements
6. **Component lifecycle**: Verify AI moves trigger proper UI updates

## Priority
Critical - This breaks a core advertised feature and prevents testing of AI functionality.

## Workaround
None - Human players must be used for all gameplay testing.

## Related Issues
This may be related to the general game state management issues causing the "New game" button to remain disabled after game completion.

## Fix Details

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the game controller's player configuration management. When users changed player types from Human to AI during an ongoing game, the existing game continued running with the original player instances. The running game was still waiting for the original Human player to make a move, even though the UI showed that both players were configured as AI.

The problem occurred because:
1. A game starts with default configuration (X = Human, O = DQN)  
2. User changes both players to Mock AI via dropdown selections
3. The `changePlayerType` function updated the configuration but did not restart the current game
4. The existing game continued with the original Human player instance waiting for user input
5. The UI showed AI player types, but the game logic was still using the old player instances

### Solution Implemented
Modified the `changePlayerType` function in `C:\Users\fschwabe\projects\tic-tac-toe\tic-tac-toe-client\src\app\hooks\useGameController.ts`:

1. **Added game cancellation logic**: When changing player types, cancel the current game by calling the existing `actionToken()`
2. **Added automatic game restart**: If there was a game in progress, automatically start a new game with the updated player configuration using `setTimeout(createNewGame, 0)`
3. **Added dependency**: Included `createNewGame` in the useCallback dependencies array

### Files Modified
- `src/app/hooks/useGameController.ts`: Enhanced `changePlayerType` function to restart games when player configuration changes

### Fix Verification  
- Changing player types during gameplay now automatically restarts the game with new player types
- AI players immediately start making automatic moves after configuration change
- No more "waiting for human input" state when both players are AI
- Game flow is seamless - users see immediate response to configuration changes
