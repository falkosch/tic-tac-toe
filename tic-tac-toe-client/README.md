# tic-tac-toe-client

A React Tic Tac Toe game where you can battle against different AI opponents or watch them duke it out against each other.

## What's This About?

Ever wondered if you could beat a neural network at tic-tac-toe? Now you can find out! This game features several AI players:

- **DQN Player** â€” A Deep Q-Network that learns through reinforcement learning, using [mvrahden's reinforce-js](https://github.com/mvrahden/reinforce-js).
- **Menace Player** â€” The classic "matchbox" AI based on Donald Michie's 1960s concept, implementation inspired by [andrewmccarthy's Python version](https://github.com/andrewmccarthy/menace).
- **Azure AI** â€” Remote AI player (when configured)
- **Mock Player** â€” Random moves for testing

You can play as human vs. AI or even set up AI vs. AI to see which AI reigns supreme.
